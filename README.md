# Elden-Ring-Level-Calculator

## What is this?

This is a simple personal project to create a website that can calculate the total of runes and time needed to farm in order to reach a certain desired level.

## The reason

While playing Elden Ring, after finishing the game once, I wanted to farm to the max level (or close to it) so I could use any weapon/build I felt like in a single character.

This time I'm using this small project to help me calculate the amount of runes needed, while also training my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

That being said, this will remain as a small personal project and be as simple as it can be. Gotta farm some runes!
